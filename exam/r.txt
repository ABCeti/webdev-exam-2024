Python library modules
----------------------

If you need to install a Python library module (or version) that isn't packaged
in Debian, we recommend installing it into a virtualenv, where possible. You
can create virtualenvs with the venv Python stdlib module (in the
"python3-venv" Debian package) or the virtualenv Python 3rd-party tool (in the
"virtualenv" Debian package).

Both of these will create an isolated environment, with a copy of pip in it.
After activating the environment, you can install python applications and
library modules into the virtual environment.

e.g. instead of running:
$ pip install --user foo
run:
$ mkdir -p ~/.venvs
$ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/foo
$ ~/.venvs/foo/bin/python -m pip install foo




v1@deb1://home/v1/Documents/webdev-exam-2024-2/exam$ sudo venvs/foo/bin/python -m pip install foo
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement foo (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for foo
